So, what exactly is a conversation going to do if the policies remain intact. Like so much this country does, once they begin a particular policy, no matter how counter-effective or foolish, the government and its appendages seem unable to really change direction and think of something new.

That Ferguson, Mo., had a 95 percent white law enforcement personnel in a community that was 70 percent black reflected an unjust racial legacy of a racially discriminatory society. And we now see in Ferguson the source of the lingering bias. It was the legislative contortions by whites in both parties defanging the 1960s Civil Rights Bills. It was compromises to pass bills outlawing white privileged status in using the general tax base from all races for white benefit. And that meant the structural bias in public employment could be manipulated in criteria to reflect skewed racial hiring of white police without specifying the race of the applicants. One glaring way to do that was to select applicants based on certification alone from institutions in white majority communities, and to permit hiring of white applicants to the police force from those training institutions in white communities. None of the Civil Rights Bills prohibited all white police enforcement of majority black communities; it was business as usual for the past two centuries.

He does not condemn this, but rather uses it as a basis for constructive suggestions such as community oriented police work and better training.  He stated, correctly, that our law enforcement professionals are and should be held to a higher standard. Whatever biases they may have, they cannot allow such biases to effect their conduct.<br/>But, Mr. Comey\'s address was far more than a lecture on police practice. He (bravely, I believe) also acknowledged the social structure in some communities which creates almost an insurmountable obstacle for some, particularly young men, to overcome.  I note that his comments about this factor went unreported by in this article, which I find disappointing. He articulated it not as an excuse for bad behavior on either side, but as a real problem that must be also be addressed to free communities of an endless cycle.<br/>Mr. Comey has set a noteworthy example.

Likewise, under Mr. Comey, the FBI exonerated itself for the highly questionable killing of Ibragim Todashev --a friend and associate of the Tsarnaev brothers -- during questioning by FBI agents after the Boston Marathon bombings.  Simply based on the law of averages, a finding that shootings were justified 100% of the time is highly suspect.  Thus, while I respect the eloquence and erudition of Mr. Comey\'s speaking and writing, I remain very skeptical that he is in any position to present the \""hard truths\"" he purports to present in an objective way.<br/><br/>Nowhere in Mr. Comey\'s speech -- and yes, I read the full text -- did he address himself to the problems in American police culture.  The old \""blue wall of silence\"" seems to have changed little since the days Frank Serpico walked a beat.  Sure, there are many cops who do not themselves engage in wrongful conduct.  But officers good and bad are nearly universal in honoring that code of silence with respect to the wrongdoing of their colleagues (the occasional Frank Serpico or Adrian Schoolcraft notwithstanding).

One was a large department in a major east coast city.  When I entered the police academy in 1970 I was with a racially diverse group.  We were encouraged to dialog among ourselves, and I can honestly say that all of us learned from each other.  Each of us hit the street wanting to do good and improve the quality of life in the districts to which we were assigned.  Having grown up in Queens and Manhattan, I considered myself pretty street wise.  But I was in for an education.  You are met with an incomprehensible level of hostility that permeates most contacts in majority African-American neighborhoods.  Trying to determine the truth is extremely difficult, and cooperation is, for the most part, nil. The potential for physical altercation is always present.  Community policing works to a point,  but it is no panacea, and it requires a response from the neighborhood that at least understands the nature and purpose of the police job.  I could tell lots of war stories, but the bottom line vis-√†-vis Mr. Comey\'s speech is that the police represent only half the equation- successful community outcomes will result only after members of the community recognize that they have a vested interest in working with the police.

The DOJ course \""Fair and Impartial Policing\"" covers this topic in detail. I think it is a great start to recognizing some of the issues. BUT, the larger problem with police-community relations is failure to educate people about the role and responsibilities of police officers. Quite often, people are willing to defy and challenge officers, resist arrest, or otherwise hamper police duties. It is illegal to resist arrest even for a minor crime. Young people think that officers cannot stop them, search them or arrest them even when they have probable cause to do so.  Many people THINK they know their rights, but are completely wrong. The majority of cops go to work to make a difference, not to hurt people or stir unrest.  People need to understand the process for dealing with officers--Comply and Complain. If you are stopped by a cop and feel you were treated badly, Comply and Complain. If the police are unprofessional or abusice--Comply and Complain. Do NOT fight with police or resist arrest!  Those who comply and complain actually make the cops\' job safer and the officers are less likely to use force or any weapons.  People who Comply and Complain have a much less likelihood of having force used and also help to improve the department and build trust in police oversight policies. Those who fight or resist police are not helping themselves or their fellow citizens.

The black kid that was running around in a public park with his sister was shot moments after the policeman stopped him.  He was no harm to the policeman--so why did he so thoughtlessly shoot?  People who may display signs of being mentally ill get killed for no reason, as well.  A girl walked into a police station with a knife recently and a cop killed her at close range.  Couldn\'t they have tried to tackle her and disarm her? There were enough police present at the time.  Turns out she had mental illness.  Yesterday, in WA state, a mexican fruit picker was throwing stones. A policeman began to shoot and the guy ran off.  Then the policeman ran and caught up with the guy and emptied a clip into him.  The excuse the cop gave later was that the guy had a big rock, as big as a softball.  In a video, the man is raising his hands before he is killed.  Why didn\'t the cop shoot at his legs and wound him?  The man seemed agitated, but that is no reason to kill him.  It seems cops these days are trigger-happy, and if they don\'t like that impression, they need to think twice about what they are doing.

In this case, the theorem states that the probability of a given person being a criminal if they are black is equal to the probability of black given criminal *if and only if* the probability of being black equals the probability of being a criminal.  It\'s hard to get firm numbers for these variables, since you have to consider \""those that got away\"" and potential racial disparities in that group, but we can still make reasonable estimates.  Looking at the number of reported crimes in NYC in 2014 (200,000) and the number of black residents (2 million), it\'s a pretty plausible statement that there are plenty more black people than there are total criminals (of all races).  The effect of this, under Bayes\' Rule, is that the absolute difference in probability (i.e. percentage points) between a white person being a criminal and a black person being a criminal shrinks, likely to the point where race ceases being useful as a discriminator of criminality relative to other observations of a potential perp (such as behavior, demeanor, visible possession of a weapon, etc.).  Consequently, it seems likely that police are overweighting race as a factor when choosing to search, detain, or question someone, given the racial disparities of, say, \""stop and frisk.\""  And this is without even considering the qualitative costs of profiling described by Contmpltv in her comment.

His central point was that black Americans had achieved liberty (this was shortly after passage of civil rights legislation) but would now want equality which is something entirely different. In fact I think by the use of devices like affirmative action programs we\'ve made quite a lot of progress in this direction (after all the president, a supreme court justice and the AG are black which would have been unthinkable in 1960) but I don\'t think all black Americans have yet achieved full equality. It\'s for this reason that it behooves the police (who are something of a closed society but have the same percentage of bad hats as society as a whole) to exercise restraint in their dealings with black Americans particularly. Right now they are generally completely trigger happy in these situations. You can argue this is extending unequal treatment to Black Americans but then they were the subject of unequal treatment in the opposite direction for four centuries.

It is also documented that Hoover assigned FBI agents to stalk Black students that were attending white colleges and that this policy continued well into the 70\'s.The FBI had agents infiltrate groups dedicated to nonviolent protest against immoral and unconstitutional laws and these agents were in general instructed to find a way to turn the peaceful organization into a violent one and to introduce and escalate the  violence whenever possible. In many cases this meant providing the organization with weapons even when no weapons were requested.

71274514,approved,"You can have the best schools, scholarships, and affirmative action plans and employment opportunities, but if you don\'t value education or possess a strong work ethic, it\'s pointless. The greatest predictor of employment success is whether a child grows up in a househeld where work is valued and demonstrated through sustained parental employment. Instead, this country has created a welfare system that fosters dependency and the expectation among some that the government will provide for all of their needs in perpetuity. That the white man owes. Government assistance is a safety net, not a way of life, and criminality should be the exception not the rule.

65312034,approved,Every person knows that the police have the authority to stop them. Getting into a fight with an officer is also  something they shouldn\'t do. The same with a man who may be off his rocker. It is not the policeman\'s job to evaluate whether a person should know better or make a psychological evaluation.

And since we do not know whether that number is correct, we cannot know whether police killings save more lives than they take (oddly, many of these killings do not involve saving anyone\'s life except perhaps those of the police officers.  We can talk all day about how to explain the 25% blacks killed by police in a general population about 11% black.  Whether \""controversial\"" or not--what defines the term? and what does it matter?--any killing is a loss of life and perhaps an innocent life and usually a loss for no valid reason: the illegal sale of a few loose cigarettes?  running from a curbside drug bust?
