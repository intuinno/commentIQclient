Quite often, people are willing to defy and challenge officers, resist arrest, or otherwise hamper police duties. It is illegal to resist arrest even for a minor crime. Young people think that officers cannot stop them, search them or arrest them even when they have probable cause to do so.  Many people THINK they know their rights, but are completely wrong. The majority of cops go to work to make a difference, not to hurt people or stir unrest.  People need to understand the process for dealing with officers--Comply and Complain. If you are stopped by a cop and feel you were treated badly, Comply and Complain. If the police are unprofessional or abusice--Comply and Complain. Do NOT fight with police or resist arrest!  Those who comply and complain actually make the cops\' job safer and the officers are less likely to use force or any weapons.  People who Comply and Complain have a much less likelihood of having force used and also help to improve the department and build trust in police oversight policies.

People who may display signs of being mentally ill get killed for no reason, as well.  A girl walked into a police station with a knife recently and a cop killed her at close range.  Couldn\'t they have tried to tackle her and disarm her? There were enough police present at the time.  Turns out she had mental illness.  Yesterday, in WA state, a mexican fruit picker was throwing stones. A policeman began to shoot and the guy ran off.  Then the policeman ran and caught up with the guy and emptied a clip into him.  The excuse the cop gave later was that the guy had a big rock, as big as a softball.  In a video, the man is raising his hands before he is killed.  Why didn\'t the cop shoot at his legs and wound him?  The man seemed agitated, but that is no reason to kill him.  It seems cops these days are trigger-happy, and if they don\'t like that impression, they need to think twice about what they are doing.

And I don\'t remember ever being told to shoot to wound an assailant. I was told however to shoot until the assailant no longer presents a danger to myself or others. Adrenalin can make a person move toward another person at 20 feet per second. There is little time to wonder if that last shot is the one that stops him. A person shot in the heart can have as much as 20 seconds of oxygen which when combined with adrenalin makes him a formidable opponent especially if he\'s armed with a pistol.

It\'s hard to get firm numbers for these variables, since you have to consider \""those that got away\"" and potential racial disparities in that group, but we can still make reasonable estimates.  Looking at the number of reported crimes in NYC in 2014 (200,000) and the number of black residents (2 million), it\'s a pretty plausible statement that there are plenty more black people than there are total criminals (of all races).  The effect of this, under Bayes\' Rule, is that the absolute difference in probability (i.e. percentage points) between a white person being a criminal and a black person being a criminal shrinks, likely to the point where race ceases being useful as a discriminator of criminality relative to other observations of a potential perp (such as behavior, demeanor, visible possession of a weapon, etc.).
