The other mention is at the end of the article where it discusses setting the bar lower to where a city like Chicago at least doesn\'t have to be as worried about losing it\'s start-ups to Silicon Valley like it used to. I find these comments as well as the limited information about Chicago as a tech hub to be rather disparaging to the city compared to other cities that Josh seemed to want to highlight, such as Provo, UT.

Take a look at the particulars that Josh mentions as to why NYC and Provo are competitive destinations for tech pros.

Josh presents two models that actually make Chicago the best of both Provo and New York as far as what the city can offer to start-ups.<br/><br/>First Model - \'People want to live there and there\'s a really good research university\'. There is an immense amount of cultural and ethnic diversity in Chicago. Lots of people want to live in Chicago. Beyond this, we have a couple of premier universities in the world in Northwestern University and University of Chicago. <br/><br/>Second Model - Cross-Industry Collaboration - Although, not on the level of NYC or LA, Chicago has a plethora of cross-industry collaboration opportunities.
