Those materials were excellent, but challenging.  My chair and the administrators from the Engineering school were upset. <br/><br/>My Chair told me that he wasn\'t going to let the Engineering School take away (the apparently highly lucrative) course and he demanded that I teach the normal \""cookbook\"" course so that he wouldn\'t have \""trouble\"".<br/><br/>When I wrote the Dean of Eng. Student Academic Integrity that the students who cheated on the homework were the ones who did poorly on the test, he replied that I shouldn\'t \""discourage\"" students and that \""retention\"" was critical.<br/><br/>On the web, one can access both the course I taught (or just the MIT course) and the \""cookbook\"" course that Wash. U., and many other schools, teach.

Data going back to the late 1980s shows that the same areas that led industries 2 1/2 decades ago continue to lead them today. Some of that is a refection of success begetting success leading to skills and capital concentrations that self-perpetuate leadership.
