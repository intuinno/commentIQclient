The app’s privacy policy prevents schools from identifying users without a subpoena, court order or search warrant, or an emergency request from a law-enforcement official with a compelling claim of imminent harm. Schools can block access to Yik Yak on their Wi-Fi networks, but banning a popular social media network is controversial in its own right, arguably tantamount to curtailing freedom of speech. And as a practical matter, it doesn’t work anyway.

First of all, most \""anonymous\"" apps are not really anonymous at all. Secondly, of course finding out who first posted an offensive post on Yik Yak requires a subpoena. Why wouldn\'t it? Thirdly, if Yik Yak is such a problem, a college or university should ban it. There is no right to hate speech guaranteed on a college campus, anymore than there is outside of the campus. <br/><br/>As for what happened with Jordan Seman at Middlebury College, it is unfortunate, but her decision to allow her picture in this article is only going to compound her campus reputation problems.
