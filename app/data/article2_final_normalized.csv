Data going back to the late 1980s shows that the same areas that led industries 2 1/2 decades ago continue to lead them today. Some of that is a refection of success begetting success leading to skills and capital concentrations that self-perpetuate leadership. Outside the US, countries have broken this cycle in a way that US private enterprise has not. South Korea, now a world power in several industries, was in the 1960s still an economic laggard recovering from war. How did they make the change?

14951172,approved,"No, Peter, this MIT grad has to disagree with you about Boston. It is ghastly in the winter and so hot and humid in the summer that outdoor activity, already limited by the lack of open space in eastern Massachusetts, becomes an ordeal. Recreational opportunities in the region are limited, too. Vermont, lovely as it is, has black flies in the summer, ice, ice, and more ice, in the winter, and mud in the spring. New Hampshire is a right wing leech fattening on Massachusetts while condemning it as Taxachusetts. The North Shore beaches have green heads from the 4th of July well into August. The roads to Cape Cod are so congested that going to the beach in the summer is more stressful than going to work.<br/><br/>I love Massachusetts for its history, its politics, and its magnificent universities, but when I left for the Pacific Northwest I thought I had died and gone to Heaven.",1425695330,0,"port angeles, wa",Kaleberg,api.nytimes.com/svc/community/v2/comments/user/id/14951172.xml,1,14341008,0,1.8214888699377876,16.470815338641543,16.981132291981133,66.03260869565217,56.76691729323308,0.0,48.118146,-123.430741,29.75462940552161,36.3463081741573,22.9572437338403,27.435153446902568,8.418367091581633,4.8574969018587355

Appallingly high violent crime rate (tied at #3 nationally w/ Birmingham, AL in the 2011 FBI report), incomprehensibly constipated, sclerotic roadways with ZERO traffic engineering or infrastructure, failing public schools, and a brutally stifling climate. Orlando has the worst of every big-city problem with non of the benefits in a city with 150,000 fewer residents than Tulsa.  Unless one desires to sit idle in traffic staring at RED on every road (brake lights and traffic lights that last forever at every intersection and driveway) when attempting to go anywhere or do anything, sitting for hours and hours and hours, stay away. It is an endurance test, an ordeal, to simply do an errand, visit a friend, get to an appointment on time, etc. Day or night, 7 days a week. It is impossible to go anywhere or do anything in Orlando. And there is little to do. To walk through the gate of any theme park, after paying $20 to park, costs more than $100 for a single ticket. Beaches are more than an hour away without traffic-and there is ALWAYS traffic. How anyone would characterize the 92+ degree/95% humidity that suffocates the region as \""nice climate\"" for most of the year is incomprehensible. The climate, the insane traffic congestion, the ridiculous crime rate, the lack of affordable recreation options, etc. The place is hell on earth.",1425744744,5,Connecticut,Thomas,api.nytimes.com/svc/community/v2/comments/user/id/61197008.xml,1,14342794,0,42.825814047950836,43.17316810066736,2.8846152028846155,84.51086956521739,85.71428571428571,36.13184615050725,41.65002,-72.734216,23.192539241565186,51.168539325842694,36.68441064638783,34.591603051454676,21.999999978,0.4322642
