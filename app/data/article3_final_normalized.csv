The app’s privacy policy prevents schools from identifying users without a subpoena, court order or search warrant, or an emergency request from a law-enforcement official with a compelling claim of imminent harm. Schools can block access to Yik Yak on their Wi-Fi networks, but banning a popular social media network is controversial in its own right, arguably tantamount to curtailing freedom of speech. And as a practical matter, it doesn’t work anyway. Students can still use the app on their phones with their cell service.\""<br/><br/>Almost none of what is stated in the above paragraph stands up to scrutiny. First of all, most \""anonymous\"" apps are not really anonymous at all. Secondly, of course finding out who first posted an offensive post on Yik Yak requires a subpoena. Why wouldn\'t it? Thirdly, if Yik Yak is such a problem, a college or university should ban it. There is no right to hate speech guaranteed on a college campus, anymore than there is outside of the campus. <br/><br/>As for what happened with Jordan Seman at Middlebury College, it is unfortunate, but her decision to allow her picture in this article is only going to compound her campus reputation problems.

They figured out my husband\'s name (different than my own) and started both harassing him and playing pranks via Linked-In (pretending to be job recruiters for fake companies). By the end, they were threatening to kill my pets and shoot warning bullets into my front window (\""if we kill one of your grandchildren....too bad\"").<br/><br/>They posted so many thousands of vile items about me, that any google search of my name brought up stuff I can\'t even print here.

Not many people on my campus would want to write a Facebook status about their depression, but you can yak about it, and nobody would know your name.<br/><br/>On any given day (especially in winter), the Northwestern feed hosts yaks about being depressed or wanting to commit suicide, but these are almost always followed by a chain of \""reyaktions\"" encouraging OP (original poster) to seek help, to not give in, to go to CAPS (Northwestern Psychological Services), etc. Or maybe it\'s \""You should think about filing a Title IX report.
