Likewise, under Mr. Comey, the FBI exonerated itself for the highly questionable killing of Ibragim Todashev --a friend and associate of the Tsarnaev brothers -- during questioning by FBI agents after the Boston Marathon bombings.  Simply based on the law of averages, a finding that shootings were justified 100% of the time is highly suspect.

It was compromises to pass bills outlawing white privileged status in using the general tax base from all races for white benefit. And that meant the structural bias in public employment could be manipulated in criteria to reflect skewed racial hiring of white police without specifying the race of the applicants. One glaring way to do that was to select applicants based on certification alone from institutions in white majority communities, and to permit hiring of white applicants to the police force from those training institutions in white communities.

Maybe have it so each officer spends one day every two weeks or so working at a soup kitchen, or working with middle and high school students to build something their school or neighborhood needs, or maybe teaching a free/low price self defense class, or coaching a team at a YMCA or Boys and Girls club.

It puts to shame the demagoguery used by leaders of all sides in this matter. His refreshing honesty acknowledges the subtle racial biases that even the most tolerant of us undoubtedly hold. He does not condemn this, but rather uses it as a basis for constructive suggestions such as community oriented police work and better training.  He stated, correctly, that our law enforcement professionals are and should be held to a higher standard. Whatever biases they may have, they cannot allow such biases to effect their conduct.<br/>But, Mr. Comey\'s address was far more than a lecture on police practice. He (bravely, I believe) also acknowledged the social structure in some communities which creates almost an insurmountable obstacle for some, particularly young men, to overcome.  I note that his comments about this factor went unreported by in this article, which I find disappointing. He articulated it not as an excuse for bad behavior on either side, but as a real problem that must be also be addressed to free communities of an endless cycle.<br/>Mr. Comey has set a noteworthy example.

It was his true experience, and it shocked him at first. He lamented the fact that he became racist, but you know what he lamented more? That one of his workers, a young Latino putting himself through community college, was shot dead by a black man because he refused to turn over the business\'s money. <br/><br/>When both police and community members have similar experiences, both will develop racist attitudes, and both begin to judge by the color of people\'s skin and anticipate something that may or may not happen. <br/><br/>Black parents need to take the lead and change the culture in the home.",Northstar5,34.053717,Los Angeles,-118.242727,approved,api.nytimes.com/svc/community/v2/comments/user/id/7784128.xml,7784128,"1,423,859,910","14,131,361",0,1,7,1,27.49878374,7.665293736,51.19681834,34.11792247,9.55882351,63.27499847,23.30954441,95.42253521,51.63145511,7.857142692,85.19362187,30.87462778"RTB: MT is not \""racializing\"" his experience.

A person shot in the heart can have as much as 20 seconds of oxygen which when combined with adrenalin makes him a formidable opponent especially if he\'s armed with a pistol.

If that is not the case, do the differences perhaps lie in how minor crimes are defined and punished?<br/><br/>What recently made me realize the risks that police officers take each day was a body-cam video of a police officer responding to a domestic disturbance call.

The officer remarked that the other man seemed very nervous, proceeding to search the man after the other had denied having a weapon.

The Agency with Hoover at the helm relentlessly harassed Martin Luther King and his family with the goal of destroying his reputation and breaking up his family. There are many historians who believe that Hoover was hoping that Dr.King would crumble under the emotional pressure and commit suicide. It is also documented that Hoover assigned FBI agents to stalk Black students that were attending white colleges and that this policy continued well into the 70\'s.The FBI had agents infiltrate groups dedicated to nonviolent protest against immoral and unconstitutional laws and these agents were in general instructed to find a way to turn the peaceful organization into a violent one and to introduce and escalate the  violence whenever possible. In many cases this meant providing the organization with weapons even when no weapons were requested.

Couldn\'t they have tried to tackle her and disarm her? There were enough police present at the time.  Turns out she had mental illness.  Yesterday, in WA state, a mexican fruit picker was throwing stones. A policeman began to shoot and the guy ran off.  Then the policeman ran and caught up with the guy and emptied a clip into him.  The excuse the cop gave later was that the guy had a big rock, as big as a softball.  In a video, the man is raising his hands before he is killed.  Why didn\'t the cop shoot at his legs and wound him?  The man seemed agitated, but that is no reason to kill him.

Many blacks happen to be poor and happen to grow up under these circumstances, and so many blacks are disproportionately involved in criminal activity.  <br/><br/>These are all theoretical, but logically-sound conclusions to draw.

Reality is that criminal behavior isn\'t limited to the black community, no matter what the statistical perception might be.

In fact I think by the use of devices like affirmative action programs we\'ve made quite a lot of progress in this direction (after all the president, a supreme court justice and the AG are black which would have been unthinkable in 1960) but I don\'t think all black Americans have yet achieved full equality. It\'s for this reason that it behooves the police (who are something of a closed society but have the same percentage of bad hats as society as a whole) to exercise restraint in their dealings with black Americans particularly.

In this case, the theorem states that the probability of a given person being a criminal if they are black is equal to the probability of black given criminal *if and only if* the probability of being black equals the probability of being a criminal.  It\'s hard to get firm numbers for these variables, since you have to consider \""those that got away\"" and potential racial disparities in that group, but we can still make reasonable estimates.  Looking at the number of reported crimes in NYC in 2014 (200,000) and the number of black residents (2 million), it\'s a pretty plausible statement that there are plenty more black people than there are total criminals (of all races).  The effect of this, under Bayes\' Rule, is that the absolute difference in probability (i.e. percentage points) between a white person being a criminal and a black person being a criminal shrinks, likely to the point where race ceases being useful as a discriminator of criminality relative to other observations of a potential perp (such as behavior, demeanor, visible possession of a weapon, etc.).
